                <br>
                Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants,
                cafes,
                a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from
                the
                beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.
                <br>
                Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a
                sun
                drenched, tree-filled private garden.
                <br>
                A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized
                bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind.
                <br>
                Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy! An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to
                stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
                <br>
                This is the perfect place for a home away from home.

                "So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!"
                <br>
                "This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing"
                <br>
                "Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive
                back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"
                <br>
                "Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt. Thank you."
                <br>
                "What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it
                and will return again and again."
                <br>
                "Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!"
                <br>
                "A few minutes’ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of
                anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"
                <br>
                Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!"
